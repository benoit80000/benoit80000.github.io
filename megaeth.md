## üöÄ What is MegaETH?

**MegaETH** is a next-gen Ethereum execution layer built for speed and user experience.  
It keeps EVM compatibility while re-architecting how blocks are produced and propagated.

- Sub-100 ms transaction latency  
- Parallel execution (multi-threaded EVM)  
- Shared global mempool  
- Same Solidity + tooling you already use

## üß† Why It Matters

MegaETH removes Ethereum‚Äôs UX bottleneck ‚Äî waiting seconds for a tx to confirm.  
Imagine DeFi, gaming, or social apps responding *instantly*, like Web2.

## üß© Core Innovations

- **Parallel compute:** concurrent transaction scheduling  
- **Optimistic block propagation:** instant user confirmations  
- **Synchronized state sharing:** less delay between nodes  
- **Full EVM compatibility:** deploy existing contracts without rewriting

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges

- Concurrency safety  
- Network bandwidth and node sync  
- Maintaining decentralization at high throughput
