## 🧭 What Is Optimism?

**Optimism** is an Ethereum Layer 2 rollup built using the **OP Stack**, a modular open-source framework.  
It aims to scale Ethereum while redistributing value back to builders and users via **retroactive public goods funding**.

---

## 🧱 Core Principles

- **Scalability through rollups**: transactions are batched to reduce gas costs.  
- **Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF)**: rewarding contributors who improve Ethereum.  
- **Open source (OP Stack)**: used by Base, Zora, and others.  
- **Community governance**: the Optimism Collective votes on direction and funding.

---

## 🧩 How to Engage

- Use dApps deployed on **Optimism Mainnet** regularly (swaps, bridges, perps).  
- Participate in **governance** (delegate, vote, propose).  
- Join **RetroPGF** programs by contributing to open-source or educational projects.  
- Bridge assets using **official Optimism Bridge**.  
- Explore **OP Stack chains** (Base, Mode, Zora, etc.).

## 💡 For Airdrop Hunters

Optimism has had **multiple airdrops** already — each rewarding different behaviors:
1. **Airdrop #1** — Early users & bridge participants.  
2. **Airdrop #2** — Governance participants.  
3. **Airdrop #3+** — Builders & public goods supporters.  

➡️ Future rounds may favor **multi-chain activity** or **cross-stack interactions**.
